Sequences are one of principal built-in data types besides numerics, mappings, files, instances and exceptions.
Python provides six sequence data types:
> strings
> byte Sequences
> byte array
> lists
> tuples
> range objects

>> The items or elements of strings, lists and tuples are ordered in a defined Sequences
>> The elements can be accessed by index

List:
• They are ordered
• The contain arbitrary objects
• Elements of a list can be accessed by an index
• They are arbitrarily nestable, i.e. they can contain other lists as sublists
• Variable size
• They are mutable, i.e. the elements of a list can be changed

Tuples:
•A tuple is an immutable list, i.e. a tuple cannot be changed in any way, once it has been created
•Tuples are faster than lists.
•If you know that some data doesn't have to be changed, you should
use tuples instead of lists, because this protects your data agains
t accidental changes.
•The main advantage of tuples is that tuples can be used as keys i
n dictionaries, while lists can't.
